# clonit

Scaffolding without the fuss.

## Core Concepts

### Run Your Templates as They Are

With **clonit**, there’s no need to adapt or convert your templates using special syntax like EJS. The scaffolding process simply copies your existing app folder as-is, meaning you can immediately execute it with commands like npm run build or npm run dev. This approach makes maintaining and updating templates effortless, since no complex transformations are required—just copy, run, and develop.

### No Template Language Overhead. Use String Replacement

**clonit** eliminates the need for template languages. It uses simple string replacement to handle inputs like project names, with values provided via the CLI. This keeps the process lightweight and intuitive, reducing complexity and setup time.
